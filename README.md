I'm a backend software developer fluent in Java, Kotlin and Scala. 
During the last year I spent some time learning Typescript and React allowing me to contribute features to a web application.

🔭 I've worked as a software developer for these companies:

- Mercado Libre / Mercado Pago (Marketplace / Fintech) Ticker: MELI
- ank (Fintech) 
- Despegar (Online travel agency) Ticker: DESP
- Wenance (Fintech) 

🗓️ Before that I've worked in:
- Software Testing (functional, manual, automated, performance)
- Leading teams doing automated testing
- Administering infrastructure both in on-premise servers, virtualized environments and in the cloud.

🌱 I’m currently learning Python, AWS, and GO
- I think python is a good tool for making tools and scripts, even better that all the languages I've already know
- I think GO is gaining traction in the industry. I've already worked with it and has proven to be a very good performing language when you need high performance in services. 
- I diving deeper in AWS practice, despite I've already worked with lots of their services, there is always room for improvement, and I consider AWS a good partner for any endeavor.
